# 🛡️ Kick.com Kasada (KPSDK) Solver – Free API Automation

This project automates the process of bypassing the Kasada (KPSDK) protection system used by **Kick.com**. It integrates with a free API on **RapidAPI** to solve Kasada challenges, automatically generates usernames and passwords, verifies emails via IMAP, and continuously registers new accounts.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ KPSDK (Kasada) solver via **RapidAPI**
* 📩 Automatic email verification using **IMAP**
* 🔐 Random username and strong password generator
* 🔁 Continuous account creation loop

---

## 🧪 Quick Start

### Requirements

* **Python 3.8+**
* Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install aiohttp aiocurl
```

### API Setup

Open `sa.py` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your RapidAPI key:

```python
headers = {
    "x-rapidapi-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-rapidapi-host": "kick-kasada-kpsdk-solver-api.p.rapidapi.com"
}
```

---

### Hotmail Source (Required)

* Obtain Hotmail addresses from: **[https://hotmail.dataarchive.site](https://hotmail.dataarchive.site)**
* Save them in `livelive.txt` with the following format (one entry per line):

```
email@hotmail.com:password
```

The script uses these accounts via IMAP to read Kick.com's verification emails.

---

### Usage

1. Add your RapidAPI key into `sa.py`.
2. Prepare `livelive.txt` with Hotmail accounts (`email:password`).
3. (Optional) Add proxies into `babaproxy.txt` (one per line).
4. Run the generator:

```bash
python accgen.py
```

> The Kasada solver logic is already implemented in `sa.py`. You only need a valid RapidAPI key.
